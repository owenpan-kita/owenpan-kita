# Owen Pan-Kita
## Hi everyone! My name is Owen Pan-Kita. I am a sophomore at Lehigh University, and am studying Journalism and Marketing. I am originally from Summit, New Jersey, which is a small suburb right outside of Manhattan. After graudation, I hope to move into the city and work for a magazine. I enjoy reading, writing, shopping, skiing, scuba diving, and traveling.
